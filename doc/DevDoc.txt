ToDo: As of 02.10.2009
======================

- (mk) Check for an alternative to output plugin content via page.1 as this could be overwritten by another plugin
- (mk) Add assertions for all file operations
- (ry21) Add possibility to add JQuery CSS files
- (ry21) Add possibility to let multiple Extensions define their jQuery requirements.
         Here is an idea on how to do that:
         1. Introduce a TS key plugin.tx_ptjqueryui_manager.extConfigs.<ext_key>
         2. Read all these configurations and merge them in one array
         3. Initialize actual manager with this merged array as configuration
